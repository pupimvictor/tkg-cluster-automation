# Using install-addon.sh

The `install-addon.sh` script is provided to simplify the installation of TMC addons. You can use it as follows:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this repository.
2. Run the following command to install the Contour addon (replace "addon_name" with your desired addon name if different):

   ```bash
   ./install-addon.sh addon_name
   ```

   This command will execute the installation of the addon using the YAML files located in the "tmc/addons/addon_name" directory.

3. Follow the on-screen prompts or provide any required input during the installation process.

4. The installation process will complete, and you will receive feedback on the success or failure of the installation.

That's it! You've successfully installed the TMC addon using the `install-addon.sh` script.
